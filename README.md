# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Explained :-

This repository contains the fundamental components of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is a brief explanation of each part:-

## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML serves as the backbone of web pages, defining the structure and content. It utilizes a markup system with tags to create elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Sample HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">

</body>
</html>
```

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is responsible for styling and layout, enhancing the visual presentation of HTML elements. It applies styles like colors, fonts, margins, and positioning. Example CSS:

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
}

p {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

## JavaScript

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can manipulate HTML and CSS, handle user input, and communicate with servers. A simple JavaScript snippet:

```javascript
// Change text on button click
function changeText() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Text changed!";
}

// Handle user input
let userInput = prompt("Enter your name:");
alert("Hello, " + userInput + "!");
```

Feel free to explore and modify these files to understand the basics of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Happy coding!
